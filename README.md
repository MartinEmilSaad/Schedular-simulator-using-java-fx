# Schedular-simulator-using-java-fx

This project was created using _**javafx**_ to simulate an OS-Schedular using scheduling techniques as :   
1 - First come first server (FCFS)  
2- shortest job first non-preemptable(SJF-NP)  
3 - shortest job first preemptable(SJF-P)  
4 - Priority-preemptable  
5 - Priority-non preemptable  

This project was transferred from jar to exe using Launch4j  


## In some techniques some information will be useless as priority in FCFS algorithm so you don't have to fill it.


Output : 
Gantt chart representing all tasks scheduling
